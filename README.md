Brazilian Trade Imbalance Analysis: Exchange Rate, Structural Dependence and Partner Clustering
## Overview

This project analyzes Brazil’s trade imbalance between 2015 and 2024, investigating whether the deficit is structurally concentrated among specific trade partners or broadly distributed.

The analysis includes:

- Trade balance calculation (exports – imports)
- Structural dependence index
- Correlation and linear regression (exchange rate vs imports)
- R² evaluation
- Partner segmentation using K-Means clustering

Results indicate that exchange rate fluctuations explain only a small portion of import variation (R² ≈ 0.09), suggesting that Brazil’s trade imbalance is predominantly structural and concentrated among specific commercial partners.
